Installation
Unpack the .zip archive into <your Secret World Directory>\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\ folder, overwrite if files already exists

If you are having problems using the slash commands then verify that the 'VFA' file is inside your <TSW installdir>\Scripts-folder, if not you have to copy it manually from the \Fashionista\Scripts folder to the <TSW installdir>\Scripts folder

It should look like this:
\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\Fashionista\CharPrefs.xml
\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\Fashionista\Modules.xml
\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\Fashionista\Fashionista.swf
\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\Fashionista\readme.txt
<TSW installdir>\Scripts\VFA

If you had TSW running when copying these files, then you must quit the game completely and then restart it or the addon won't work properly!

Uninstallation
Delete the \Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\Fashionista folder
Delete the <TSW installdir>\Scripts\VFA file
