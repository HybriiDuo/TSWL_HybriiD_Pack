I should probably tell you a little about the effects list (there on the left). Here you can list effects you want your visualizers to care about. It's the core of the whole add-on.

You don't have to write out every effect long-form, though - if you've got a load of effects that all end the same but maybe start differently (like the Chaos Enigmas), you can just use a * instead of the different part. So "* Enigma" would match "Potencey Enigma" and "Avoidance Enigma". That's saved you some typing right there. If you want to affect everything a visualizer displays, you can use * on it's own. Note that, for now, you can only have one * per line.

The colour of a given visualizer is set down in the bottom right. You can use the normal TS:L colours, or choose a custom colour. The custom colour starts off as a horrible shade of teal, so you should probably change that if you don't like teal. But if you want some effects to have a colour of their very own, you can just add a colour code after the effect name in the effects list. Colour codes look like "#FF00FF". You use a # symbol, then a hexadecimal colour code. That "#FF00FF" gives a nasty bright magenta. "#FF0000" gives a bright red. Try it out, and don't be scared to google "hexadecimal colour codes" if you get stuck. If you want to use the default TSW colour for an effect, just use #sys.

There are a few different types of visualizer, with more on the way. The default looks like a big rectangle but there are others, too. Try them out! Some are marked as prototypes - these are likely to change and be improved in the future, but they should stay very similar in what they do.
