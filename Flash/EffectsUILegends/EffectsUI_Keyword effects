You can hide things, if you want to. Effects can be hidden when they have a certain stack count, or a certain amount of time remaining. To hide an effect 
based on stack count, just use the keyword "vanish:" followed by a single stack number or stack range, like so:

Debilitated | &lt;10 vanish
Debilitated | 1-6 vanish
Debilitated | 10 vanish

If you are interested in hiding an effect based on the time remaining, you can do so in a similar manner - just make sure that you are specifying a time in seconds and not a stack count. Times look just like numbers with an "s" at the end, like so:

Debilitated | &lt;5s vanish
Debilitated | 5s-10s vanish

Other keywords are listed below, and can be applied to any effect in the same manner as "vanish:":

pulse - adds a strobe effect
excite - makes some elements jump around
fade - adds a fade effect
novanish - removes any vanish effect
nopulse - removes any strobe effect
noexcite - removes any excite effect
nofade - removes any fade effect

Keywords can also be used without a stack or time specification, like so:

Full House | pulse
Full House | excite
