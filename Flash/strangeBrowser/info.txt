Web-Browser V2 (Strange-Browser, 0.1) by 7three (ign Yosupai)

Install: Copy content of .zip file to "\The Secret World\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\"
Uninstall: Delete "WebBrowser.swf" and folder "strangeBrowser" from  "\The Secret World\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\"

Please note that strangeBrowser.swf do not have any visible content. It's just a "pipeline" to store config settings.

What's new:
- Various little changes (like text selecting in the adress bar)
- Save Position, Size and Toggle (also when enter a new zone)
- Simple Bookmarks
- Set/Save Startpage
- Keep Browser History alive (also when enter a new zone)
- Zoom mode (experimental - maybe useful to view a small-sized homepage like wikipedia)

Hope it work as good as it do on my pc... ;)

Why "Strange"?
Because it's strange that nobody did a mod for this so far. I think it's a handy tool instead of alt + tab.
And also the strange guy who made the source file (sorry for that :P)
