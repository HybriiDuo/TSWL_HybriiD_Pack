For the brave, there is an option to enable/disable visualizers via the TSW command line. The command syntax is as follows:

To enable a visualizer, use:

/setoption EffectsUILegends_Visualizer "[VISUALIZER NAME] 1"

To disable a visualizer, use:

/setoption EffectsUILegends_Visualizer "[VISUALIZER NAME] 0"

For example, 

/setoption EffectsUILegends_Visualizer "DPS Buffs 0"

will disable any visualizers that are named Major Buffs. You can even use a wildcard in the name, like

/setoption EffectsUILegends_Visualizer "Raid* 0"

which will disable all visualizers that have names that start with "Raid".
