Effects UI is a Secret World: Legends add-on intended to let you display buffs in a number of informative styles. 

The idea is to specify effects (or collections of effects) that you want to show on screen (generally at the left of the Configuration dialog) and to then define how you want them to appear (generally on the middle and right). You can monitor effects on yourself, effects on your target and effect on your friends. Individual visualizers can be enabled, disabled, created anew and destroyed entirely.  If you want to discover everything that the add-on can do, the best way thing to do is to dive in and explore. You can't break anything, as such, and there's a few more pages of help in this dialog to tell you about the less obvious features.

This addon has been worked on over a number of years, with a great deal of brilliant feedback from the community. It's a mature and stable bit of software and it does what it does pretty well, I think. If you want to say thanks by buying me a long distance beer or two, please do head on over to <a href="https://mods.curse.com/tsw-mods/tsw/271262-effects-ui-legends/"><font color="#8888FF"><u>https://mods.curse.com/tsw-mods/tsw/271262-effects-ui-legends</u></font></a>, where you can leave a donation. It's always nice to feel a) appreciated and b) slightly drunk.
